# SEOmatic Presentation

These are the notes for a presentation about Contributing to Git for Northern Colorado JavaScript

The slide deck uses [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). To run
locally you need to serve up the content with a local http server, so
something like the following should work:

```sh
 $ git clone https://github.com/jshamley/git-contrib
 $ cd seomatic
 $ npm install
 $ npm start
 Available on: http://127.0.0.1:8001
 Available on: http://192.168.0.146:8001
 Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```
